# BAGFACIO

v0.0.9

### Cool Social Bot for interestingness and fun.

Facebook* is dull and no one likes my crap on there.
So I've asked Señor Bagfacio to step in and help out.

Bagfacio generates and posts inspirational quotes overlaid on images, as well as wikipedia links and regular images with captions.

Lets see if a bilge spouting robot locum can be more popular than meat me.

Señor Bagfacio is made with PHP and uses the Facebook PHP SDK and relies on the Open Graph API

As of v.0.0.5 he has the ability to post to twitter too.

This runs on a cronjob on my server, at a frequency that has yet to get me into trouble with facebook. I leave this to your own judgement.

****************
* and now - Twitter too...

### Achtung!
Your 'friends' may think you're having a nervous breakdown and Facebook may ban you for life. Use at your own risk.
