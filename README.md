# BAGFACIO

v0.0.4

### Cool Facebook Bot for interestingness and fun.

Facebook is dull and no one likes my crap on there.
So I've asked Señor Bagfacio to step in and help out.

He's going to generate links to wikipedia articles and post wonderful photographs with witty captions.
Lets see if a rubbish spouting robot locum can be more popular than meat me.

Señor Bagfacio is made with PHP and uses the Facebook PHP SDK and relies on the Open Graph API

This runs on a cronjob on my server, at a frequency that has yet to get me into trouble with facebook. I leave this to your own judgement.


### Achtung!
Your 'friends' may think you're having a nervous breakdown and Facebook may ban you for life. Use at your own risk.
